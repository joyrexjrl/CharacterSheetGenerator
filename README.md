# Character Sheet Generator

This website generates random characters for Old School Essentials, and Shadowrun 3rd Ed (more to come soon) tabletop RPG games.
It's designed to be a fun and easy way to come up with interesting new character ideas.

# Usage

Simply visit the website at https://joyrexjrl.github.io/CharacterSheetGenerator/, if making a character for (OSE) Old School Essentials,
you have the option of either picking some criteria for the generator to follow or just go completely random and see what you get.
As for shadowrun (still under construction), for now the generator is completely random. I may add some user critera to the generator.

# Features

• Randomly generates characters with unique attributes, such as race, class, and abilities.
• Includes a visual representation of the character and their attributes.
• Easy to use and no installation required.
• Can be used for any tabletop RPG game (so long as it is OSE or Shadowrun 3rd ed, for the time being).

# Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this project, please contace me at ricklozano@gmail.com with the subject line of character generator.
I am always looking for ways to improve my code ability and looking for other ttrpg games to add to the site for the future.

# Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by my lazyness in making characters for some game systems as a person who runs many games. I wanted an easy
way to create non player characters for these games.
